# Setup
This app requires Python 3.9 to be installed.

# Usage 
'twitterscrape.py' gives the files 'eurosoc.csv' and 'eurosong.csv', which contain scraped tweets using '#euro2021' and '#eurovision', posted in the time frame in which the two events took place. Scraping takes multiple hours, we already provided the final .csv files.

'classifier.py' gives 2 csv files containing the results which our hatespeech detecting classifier predicted.
